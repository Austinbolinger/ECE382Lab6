Description: Lab 6 is IR signals talking to a robot. This builds off of lab 5 where we found a way to use our remote controlls to operate the LCD. Now the remotes will control a robot.

O is for Output pin. G is for Ground pin. Vcc is for the power pin. And, the Output pin was actually attached to the Xin pin on the MSP430 not the port 1.3.
